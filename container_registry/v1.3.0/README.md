>### Notes: ###

>1. The georeplications is only supported on new resources with the Premium SKU.
>2. The georeplications list cannot contain the location where the Container Registry exists.
>3. If more than one georeplications block is specified, they are expected to follow the alphabetic order on the location property.
>4. quarantine_policy_enabled, retention_policy, trust_policy, export_policy_enabled and zone_redundancy_enabled are only supported on resources with the Premium SKU.
>5. Changing the zone_redundancy_enabled forces the a underlying replication to be created.
>6. network_rule_set is only supported with the Premium SKU at this time.
>7. Azure automatically configures Network Rules - to remove these you'll need to specify an network_rule_set block with default_action set to Deny.
>8. The managed identity used in encryption also needs to be part of the identity block under identity_ids
