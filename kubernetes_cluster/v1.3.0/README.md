> This requires that the Preview Feature Microsoft.ContainerService/HTTPProxyConfigPreview is enabled and the Resource Provider is re-registered, see the documentation for more information.
> A migration scenario from service_principal to identity is supported. When upgrading service_principal to identity, your cluster's control plane and addon pods will switch to use managed identity, but the kubelets will keep using your configured service_principal until you upgrade your Node Pool.
> Since the Application Gateway is deployed inside a Virtual Network, users (and Service Principals) that are operating the Application Gateway must have the Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action permission on the Virtual Network or Subnet.

> If you use BYO DNS Zone, AKS cluster should either use a User Assigned Identity or a service principal (which is deprecated) with the Private DNS Zone Contributor role and access to this Private DNS Zone. If UserAssigned identity is used - to prevent improper resource order destruction - cluster should depend on the role assignment.
> To enable Azure AD Workload Identity oidc_issuer_enabled must be set to true.
> Enabling this option will allocate Workload Identity resources to the kube-system namespace in Kubernetes. If you wish to customize the deployment of Workload Identity, you can refer to the documentation on Azure AD Workload Identity. The documentation provides guidance on how to install the mutating admission webhook, which allows for the customization of Workload Identity deployment.

> If specifying ingress_application_gateway in conjunction with only_critical_addons_enabled, the AGIC pod will fail to start. A separate azurerm_kubernetes_cluster_node_pool is required to run the AGIC pod successfully. This is because AGIC is classed as a "non-critical addon".
